            Bowling Journey

        <p>
            Starting in September, I decided to get into bowling and track my progress.
            The table below shows all of my games from September 2nd, 2023 to today. 
            While the graph may not be shooting up quickly, I am seeing steady progess and I can feel it when I hit the lanes.

        <p>
            So far, my highest score has been 181. Frame-by-frame is shown below. It isn't the prettiest game of all of time, but it really shows how
            getting marks (strikes and spares) in a row can really shoot up your score.

        <h2>
            Bowling Balls
        </h2>
        <p>
            For the games from the middle of October to to the middle of December, I was using a 10 lb RotoGrip Hustle.
            This ball performed great and the solid reactive coverstock provide some nice hook. 
        </p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <img class="image" src="photos/bowling/rotogrip-hustle.jpg" />
            <p class="description">RotoGrip Hustle</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            While I liked the Hustle, being only 10 lbs it wouldn't create as much pin-action as I would like, causing me to leave a lot of 
            single pins after my first shot. To fix this issue, I had to move up in weight.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of Decemeber, I picked up a 12 lb Blue "Not Urethane" Hammer. Coming in with that gorgeous UNC blue, 
            this ball is awesome. With the combination of the core and reactive resin coverstock, this ball hooks! And with the added weight, 
            it creates the pin-action that the Hustle was missing. 
        </p>

        <div class="image-box">
            <img class="image" src="photos/bowling/blue-nu-hammer.jpg" />
            <p class="description">Blue "Not Urethane" Hammer</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            With this new Hammer, I noticed my spare game was weak with it. Unlike the Hustle, the Hammer has a full reactive core 
            inside the ball. This core is designed to leverage gyroscopic forces to add hook to the ball. While throwing strikes, this is great.
            When throwing straight spares, this is very annoying. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a more consistent spare game, I knew it was time to pick up a dedicated spare ball. Keeping the blue theme going in my bag, I 
            decided to pick up a 12 lb Storm Ice. Nothing fancy going on with this, just a pearl coverstock designed to go straight as an arrow.
        </p>


        <div class="image-box">
            <img class="image" src="photos/bowling/storm-ice.jpg" />
            <p class="description">Storm Ice</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            That's where I am now! Currently bringing my Blue NU Hammer and Storm Ice to the lanes with me. I am keeping 
            my Hustle nearby just in case those heavier 12 lb balls start impacting my shoulder health.
        </p>
